          <p class='font12 in cen cent'> collaboration between Lakeside Church of Folsom, CA, Harvest Church of God, Ethiopia, and EAVO, this project aimed to enhance water accessibility in Ajo, Ethiopia. The team, including Bob Gross and Lee Jimison, worked tirelessly to develop and increase the flow of water from a local spring into a distribution system. This not only provided abundant water to the community but also supported EAVO's kindergarten school. As a bonus, Lakeside Church's generosity allowed for additional improvements, such as funding window glass for the school.</p>

          <p class='font12 in cen cent march'> In March 2018, Executive Director Seifu Ibssa, accompanied by members of the Sacramento Rotary Club, visited the Acheber region to witness the progress of a significant water project. Through a successful partnership with the Rotary Club, the project aimed to provide clean water to sixteen distribution centers in Acheber villages, eliminating the need for arduous journeys to fetch unclean river water. Each distribution center now features four spigots, ensuring access to clean water for the community.</p>
