                        fortified, providing a more conducive learning environment. The innovative initiative to sell
                        clean water ensures sustainability, with proceeds supporting dedicated educators.
                        Meanwhile, Acheber Town's preschool, operational for two years, receives the esteemed
                        designation of the top preschool in the South-Western Shoa Zone, a testament to the
                        transformative impact of your support. In Kisumu, Kenya, Purpose Driven School expresses deep
                        gratitude for the purchase of 68 treated mosquito bed nets, a vital step in combating malaria, a
                        prevalent threat to African children and expectant mothers.
