        <p class='in phi phia'>At East African Village Outreach (EAVO), we draw inspiration from the compassionate example set by Jesus Christ. In alignment with His teachings, we believe in tending to the immediate physical needs of individuals as a precursor to addressing their spiritual well-being. Our approach is rooted in building genuine connections with people in rural villages, emphasizing humanitarian efforts to establish trust and understanding.</p>
